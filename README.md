# Linux and Mac Configuration files

These are my config files for linux and mac and also some patched nerdfonts. I try to keep this repo updated and add more stuff regularly. 

## Includes:
  - i3-gapps files in the linux folder which also includes:
    - polybar config
    - kitty config
    - compton(tryone) cnofig
    - rofi config
  - .zshrc files for both mac and linux 
  - aliases files for both mac and linux 
  - some patched nerdfornts
  
 ## Notes 
 1. The linux config files have been tested on Ubuntu 19.10
 2. To see my i3 config refer to this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/cwlk8i/i3gaps_a_blurry_rice/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
    - PS: This is an old post when i was using manjaro but the config files now work with Ubuntu. (I have not tested them on Manjaro)
